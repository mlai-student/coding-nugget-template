\section{Introduction}

One particular use case for this template are \emph{Lamarr Coding Nuggets}.
Coding nuggets are currently (short) how-tos that show how to solve problems ``by foot'' in practice.
The typical structure of such a paper consists of motivating a (machine learning) problem, showing how to formulate this problem in a particular way and then showing how to solve it practically using existing methods. 

Examples (from good old ML2R times) include ``Solving Linear Programming Problems'' \cite{Welke2020-SLP} and ``Linear Programming for Robust Regression'' \cite{Welke2020-SLP2}.
In the latter example, e.g. we show how to fit a linear model to data by minimizing least absolute deviations, instead of the more common least squares. 
To this end, we formulate the optimization problem, transform it to show that it can be solved by linear programming and then solve it in \keyword{python} using methods from \keyword{numpy} and \keyword{scipy} alone.  

\section{Technical Details}
\verb+preamble.tex+ contains several imports and definitions. 
There is a part marked optional that you can change, remove or add to as you please. 
Please refrain from changing the part, however, that is marked as non-optional.
Below we give a short introduction to 

\subsection{Colors}
The preamble defines the Lamarr Institute corporate design colors that should be used throughout the document and within figures (cf. Fig.~\ref{colors}) to provide a common look and feel:

\textcolor{lmrrblu}{blue} & : & \textcolor{lmrrblu}{lmrrblu} \\
\textcolor{lmrryel}{yellow} & : & \textcolor{lmrryel}{lmrryel} \\
\textcolor{lmrrred}{red} & : & \textcolor{lmrrred}{lmrrred} \\
\textcolor{lmrrtrq}{turquoise} & : & \textcolor{lmrrtrq}{lmrrtrq} \\
 \end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\subsection{Python Code and keywords}

Python code with pretty printing is supported. 
Inline code looks like this:
\begin{pythontxt}
vecWLAD = result.x[:m]
print('w0 =',vecWLAD[0])
print('w1 =',vecWLAD[1])
\end{pythontxt}

An example of a longer, floating python code environment can be found in Listing~\ref{code}.


\begin{python}[float=t!, caption={setting up a linear programming problem}, label={code}, emph={}, numbers=left, numbersep=5pt]
matA = np.zeros((2*n, m+n))
matA[:n,:m] = +matF.T
matA[n:,:m] = -matF.T
matA[:n,m:] = -np.eye(n)
matA[n:,m:] = -np.eye(n)

vecB = np.zeros(2*n)
vecB[:n] = +vecY
vecB[n:] = -vecY

vecC = np.hstack((np.zeros(m), np.ones(n)))
\end{python}
